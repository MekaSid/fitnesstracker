# Fitness Tracker Application
The Fitness Tracker Application is a Java-based program designed to help users manage their fitness routines by tracking exercises, trainers, and workouts. Featuring a user-friendly GUI built with JavaFX and data persistence through a MySQL database, the application allows users to securely sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Key functionalities include viewing and sorting exercises and trainers, managing workouts with the ability to generate random exercise plans, and secure user authentication. The initial console-based implementation facilitated thorough testing of core features before integrating the graphical interface, ensuring a stable and robust user experience.
